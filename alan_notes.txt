play with graphcut code to remove the audience (25 mins) ->have demo code working for full scale images

by increasing the smothing factor, bettwe reults are obtained such that the two regions are separated clearly

research methods of player segmentation (25) -> list of methods to experiments with
colour segmentation using means shift
kmeans and graph cut
colour thresholding
eucliden distnace(tut3)





#####TODO#####
1 for q5.m use change roi to green colour so user interaction is not required... done
2 apply thresholding and blob detection to detect players... done

#### IMAGE TRANSFORM ####
image registration
how do you associate the lines with the real world goal box?
give that we have the lines get the beginning and end points
go throught the combination of lines, sum the angles to 360
or which three lines add to 180

use an assumption that we are ignoring the image classification

you know that the two lines that are parallel run along the length of the field and the third lines is parallel to the width of the field

the geometric centroid of those three lines will be the geometric centroid of the three lines in the real world.

also take one of the points that are the intersection of two of the lines


calculate the centroid to make sure that the shape is convex becuase rectangles are convex


ok so, use the hough transform code on the binary image that contains the field box.
be able to identify which lines corrspond to the lines in real life. the point of getting the lines is to be able to extract atleast two points which we know map to two real life points. With this information we will be able to transform the points in pixel space to the field space and thus if we know the pixel coordinates of the players then we can know their real world coordinates! 



##### Using Kmeans and graph cut to detect players ####
using 'alan.png'


write a blob detection function that extracts the blobs larger than 300px^2 and puts a rectangle around the players with yellow jerseys

last thing i worked on
each frame function only shows players with yellow jersey

what to do next?
find the players who dont have yellow jerseys
all minus yellow?

work out how to do cool tracking 
work out how to to projective transformations!!!!!!
write up report on what ive done so far
