play with graphcut code to remove the audience (25 mins) ->have demo code working for full scale images

by increasing the smothing factor, bettwe reults are obtained such that the two regions are separated clearly

research methods of player segmentation (25) -> list of methods to experiments with
colour segmentation using means shift
kmeans and graph cut
colour thresholding
eucliden distnace(tut3)





#####TODO#####
1 for q5.m use change roi to green colour so user interaction is not required... done
2 apply thresholding and blob detection to detect players... done
